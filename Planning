Okay, so I think I have an idea of how we're going to implement our game objects.

Entity is the base class for anything that's going to appear in a room

Actors store their own location and moving them changes their location field

Items are dependent on the rooms that they are in or the actors carrying them, and so they don't need a location field
Moving items consist of the adding and removing them from room and actor inventories
